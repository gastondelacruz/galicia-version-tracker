## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Agent Commitment

**Every change you generate MUST respect ALL rules in this document.**

Before returning any code:

1. ✅ Verify compliance with ALL rules
2. ✅ Execute ALL validations
3. ✅ Report validation results explicitly

**If you cannot comply with a rule, you MUST explain why before proposing the solution.**

---

## 🚫 Absolute Prohibitions

These are **NEVER** allowed:

- ❌ Using `any` type
- ❌ Using `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error`
- ❌ Modifying code outside the requested scope
- ❌ Adding dependencies without explicit justification
- ❌ Hardcoding values (use `businessRules.ts`)
- ❌ Skipping validations
- ❌ Leaving lint/type/test errors unresolved

---

## ✅ Validation Process (MANDATORY)

### Before ANY code change is complete:

**Execute**: `npm verify`

This runs in sequence:

1. **Lint** (`npm lint`)

   - Must pass with 0 errors
   - No critical warnings
   - Includes security checks

2. **Security** (`npm security`)

   - No moderate+ severity vulnerabilities
   - Scans all dependencies

3. **Build** (`npm build`)

   - Must compile with 0 type errors
   - Successful build required

4. **Tests** (`npm test:run`)
   - All tests must pass
   - No failed tests

### Completion Gate

A task is **NOT COMPLETE** unless:

- ✅ All AGENTS.md rules are respected
- ✅ All validations executed and passed
- ✅ Results explicitly reported in response

**Skipping validation = FAILED TASK**

## 📋 Code Quality Rules

> Detailed patterns live in the skills. Always invoke the relevant skill before implementing.
>
> - **React components & hooks** → [`react` skill](skills/react/SKILL.md)
> - **TypeScript types & interfaces** → [`typescript` skill](skills/typescript/SKILL.md)
> - **Constants, imports & file placement** → [`code-standards` skill](skills/code-standards/SKILL.md)

---

## 🧪 Testing Rules (MANDATORY)

```typescript
// ✅ DO - Test behavior
describe("ProductCard", () => {
  it("displays product name and price", () => {
    render(<ProductCard product={mockProduct} />);
    expect(screen.getByText("Product Name")).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});

// ❌ DON'T - Test implementation
it("calls useState with false", () => {
  const spy = jest.spyOn(React, "useState");
  render(<ProductCard />);
  expect(spy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(false);
});
```

**Rules:**

- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use descriptive test names
- Minimize mocking
- Only write tests when applicable

## ⚙️ Critical Configurations

### tsconfig.app.json

```json
{
  "exclude": ["src/**/*.test.ts", "src/**/*.test.tsx", "src/test/**"]
}
```

**Never** use `allowExportNames` workaround.

## 🔄 Workflow Summary

1. **Understand** the requested change
2. **Plan** which files need modification — **show the plan and wait for approval before writing any code**
3. **Verify** rules compliance before coding
4. **Implement** following all rules
5. **Run** `npm verify` and fix any issues
6. **Report** validation results explicitly
7. **Explain** any rule exceptions (if unavoidable)

---

## ❓ When in Doubt

- Keep it simple
- Follow existing patterns
- Ask for clarification before breaking rules
- Validate early and often
- Prioritize maintainability over cleverness

---

## 🚨 Critical Rules (Never Violate)

1. 🔴 **NO AUTO-COMMIT**: Never create commits unless the user explicitly requests it
2. ✅ **Validate Before Complete**: Run `npm verify` — all checks must pass before reporting done
3. 🚫 **No `any` type**: Use `unknown`, proper types, or generics instead
4. 📌 **Constants Only**: Never hardcode business values — always use `businessRules.ts`
5. 🧩 **UI Components = Presentation Only**: Extract logic to custom hooks or services
6. 🧪 **Test Behavior**: Never test implementation details (no spying on `useState`, etc.)
7. 📂 **Path Aliases Always**: Never use relative paths like `../../shared/...`
8. 🛑 **Confirm Before Every Change**: Before writing or modifying ANY file, present the exact list of changes planned (file path + what will change) and wait for explicit user approval. Do NOT write code until the user confirms with "yes", "ok", "adelante", or equivalent.
